Good:
- Feels fun to play
- Plenty of options for scout to jump around

Bad:
- Consider removing left room roof 
- Make blocks which are slightly too high to jump to obvious that they cannot be reavched
- Right building door missing side

- consider making the block to the right of the right building an area for player to reacfh the cp faster (change to have a slight slope)
- resupply locker animation
- Invisible walls around edges
- Consider adding a wall in the center of the area under the cp
